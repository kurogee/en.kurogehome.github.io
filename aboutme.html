            <h2>About name and where I live</h2>
            <p>
                My name (nickname on the internet) is Kuroge. I'm a student in Japan. <br>
                I live in Nagano pref., Japan. I live in nature-rich area, so I can see mountains on full view. <br>
            </p>

            <h2>About my hobby</h2>
            <p>
                I like coding. I'm good at HTML, Javascript, and Python. I often make programs and websites like this one. <br>
                And I use Linux (Ubuntu budgie) as my main OS, so nowadays I don't use Windows. <br>
            </p>

            <h2>About my favorite food</h2>
            <p>
                I like Japanese foods. I especially like the foods using raw fish such as sushi and sashimi. <br>
                Also, I like Chinese foods and Italian foods. Especially, I often eat instant noodles. I like them because they're easy to cook. <br>
